				<p>This is the story of a <a href="https://github.com/18sg/">group of
				Computer Science undergraduates</a> and
				our quest to avoid work at all costs by building a
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation">home automation</a>
				system for their house. Its a tale of ridiculous hacks, novel
				architectures and, above all, <del>liberal use of blu-tack</del> fun.</p>
				
				<p>After meeting in our first year we decided we wanted to try and do
				something cool with our house. The resulting list of ideas was laughably
				ambitious, especially given that we couldn't really do anything to the
				building itself and that we also had to eat.</p>
				
				<p>Two years and many hacks later and we have a remarkably feature-rich
				home automation system. We've got automated lights, media control, a
				washing machine that emails you, a recipe-browsing control panel, an
				electronic door-stop, a <a
				href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvLDm8821jQ">doop</a> button and
				more! The whole thing is built on our own custom home automation system,
				'SHET', and designed to be extremely hackable.</p>
				
				<h2>In The Beginning... (Motivation)</h2>
				
				<p>We started our grand plan listing off all manner of things we wanted
				our system to do. Apart from the slight concern of how we'd afford food
				after building this system, we also had to consider the wrath of the
				landlord. Whatever we built would have to be easily removed and not do
				(too much) damage to the house.</p>
				
				<img class="figure left" src="images/frontDoor.jpg" alt="The front of the house">
				<p>Our search for a house was a mixed affair. In the 3rd house with
				more mould than wallpaper, Tom was excited to discover one who's
				electricity meter had a light that flashed at a rate proportional to
				usage. Despite this critically important feature, we eventually decided
				to go somewhere else and landed up at 18 South Grove.</p>
				
				<p>With our house found, we started thinking about what we wanted our
				home automation system to be like. Looking around the web we discovered
				that most systems were pretty bad. They generally were pretty clunky and
				seemingly <a
				href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X10_(industry_standard)">designed for
				a bygone era</a> or <a href="http://www.lightwaverf.com/"
				rel="nofollow">extremely limited and closed</a>. We wanted something
				that was really flexible, hackable and actually nice to work with.</p>
				
				<p>Seeing as we are all students, things were obviously going to have to
				be cheap. This ruled out a lot of options where specialist hardware was
				needed. Electronics knowledge (for all but Tom) was also in short
				supply which meant that the system would have to be electrically fairly
				simple. It also meant that high-voltage stuff was completely out of
				bounds.</p>
				
				<h2>SHET House Event Tunnelling (Designing the Software)</h2>
				
				<p>Our reaction to the problem of making the system hackable was a
				somewhat obvious one for any self-respecting *nix user:
				<blockquote>
					"Shell scripts!"
					<span class="attribution">Jonathan</span>
				</blockquote>
				Luckily, sanity prevailed but the idea stuck. We decided that having a
				file system-like tree containing all the controllable things in our
				house was a cool way of doing things.
