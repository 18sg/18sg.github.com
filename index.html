			<p>This is the story of a <a href="https://github.com/18sg/">group of
			Computer Science undergraduates</a> and our quest to avoid work at all
			costs by building a <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation">home automation</a>
			system for their house. Its a tale of ridiculous hacks, novel
			architectures and, above all, <del>liberal use of blu-tack</del> fun.</p>
			
			<p>After meeting in our first year we decided we wanted to try and do
			something cool with our house. The resulting list of ideas was laughably
			ambitious, especially given that we couldn't really do anything to the
			building itself and that we also had to eat.</p>
			
			<p>Two years and many hacks later and we have a remarkably feature-rich
			home automation system. We've got automated lights, media control, a
			washing machine that emails you, a recipe-browsing control panel, an
			electronic door-stop, a <a
			href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvLDm8821jQ">doop</a> button and
			more! The whole thing is built on our own custom home automation system,
			'SHET', and designed to be extremely hackable.</p>
			
		<h2>In The Beginning... (Motivation)</h2>
			
			<p>We started our grand plan listing off all manner of things we wanted
			our system to do. Apart from the slight concern of how we'd afford food
			after building this system, we also had to consider the wrath of the
			landlord. Whatever we built would have to be easily removed and not do
			(too much) damage to the house.</p>
			
			<img class="figure right hspace"
			     src="images/powerMeter.png"
			     alt="Power meter with a blinking light.">
			<p>Our search for a house was a mixed affair. In the 3rd house with
			more mould than wallpaper, Tom was excited to discover one who's
			electricity meter had a light that flashed at a rate proportional to
			usage. Despite this critically important feature, we eventually decided
			to go somewhere else and landed up at 18 South Grove.</p>
			
			<p>With our house found, we started thinking about what we wanted our
			home automation system to be like. Looking around the web we discovered
			that most systems were pretty bad. They generally were pretty clunky and
			seemingly <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X10_(industry_standard)">designed for
			a bygone era</a> or <a href="http://www.lightwaverf.com/"
			rel="nofollow">extremely limited and closed</a>. We wanted something
			that was really flexible, hackable and actually nice to work with.</p>
			
			<p>Seeing as we are all students, things were obviously going to have to
			be cheap. This ruled out a lot of options where specialist hardware was
			needed. Electronics knowledge (for all but Tom) was also in short
			supply which meant that the system would have to be electrically fairly
			simple. It also meant that high-voltage stuff was completely out of
			bounds.</p>
				
		<h2>SHET House Event Tunnelling (Designing the Software)</h2>
			
			<p>Our reaction to the problem of making the system hackable was a
			somewhat obvious one for any self-respecting *nix user:
			<blockquote>
				"Shell scripts!"
				<span class="attribution">Jonathan</span>
			</blockquote>
			Luckily, sanity prevailed but the idea stuck. We decided that having a
			file system-like tree containing all the controllable things in our
			house was a cool way of doing things. For example,
			<code>/lounge/lights</code> would control the lights in the lounge and
			<code>/jonathan/sound/speakers/volume</code> would control the volume of
			Jonathan's speakers.</p>
			
			<div class="figure center">
				<img src="images/shetPaths.png"
				     alt="Examples of SHET controlable items labelled with path names">
			</div>
			
			<p>With the idea of a 'file-system' full of real things, we set out to
			think about how this could work. We eventually settled with the idea
			that there would be three types of thing in the system:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Properties:</strong>
					For example, 'light' or 'volume'. These are values that can be got
					and set.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Events:</strong>
					For example, 'motion detected' or 'washing finished'. These are
					events that can be triggered by real-world or software events.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Actions:</strong>
					For example, 'close door', 'pause' or 'is washing machine in use'.
					These are a bit like function calls and can optionally take
					arguments and return values.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, this model doesn't really fit into a real file system
			and so the idea of using a <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace">FUSE</a>
			file system to literally 'mount' our house was quickly abandoned.
			Instead we settled on producing a command-line utility and API for
			accessing the system.</p>
			
			<p>Since the system was going to be house-wide it was going to need to
			run across a network. After looking around for libraries and protocols
			we could use to implement our system we eventually decided to write our
			own. Event-based systems existed but they were either far too
			enterprisey or too complicated. We also looked at using a standard <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC</a>
			library but these once again proved overly complicated and lacked a
			reasonable way dealing with events.</p>
			
			<div class="figure center">
				<img src="images/shetSystemModel.png"
				     alt="A server with multiple clients acting together as an alarm.">
			</div>
			<p>We decided on a centralised architecture with a single server and
			multiple clients. In our system the server would be pretty 'dumb' with
			all the application logic going on in the clients. The clients tell the
			server what nodes in the tree they contained and set/get properties,
			call actions or listen for events via the server that were created by
			other clients.</p>
			
			<p>For example, we could have a client connected to light switches in the
			house, a client which monitored motion sensors and another client which
			listened for motion events from the second client and turned lights
			attached to the first on and off as needed. We could also run clients on
			our own computers to allow media players to be controlled over SHET.</p>
			
			<p>Speed wasn't an issue seeing as this would be running on a LAN and so
			we focused our efforts on making the protocol simple human readable.
			After wrangling with some RPC frameworks and seeing how much hassle data
			types were, we decided we didn't want to deal with type-safety and so
			using <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> to encapsulate values in the
			system seemed like a good idea. From there it was obvious to use JSON to
			encode messages in the protocol too. After a late night on IRC Tom and
			Jonathan settled on what became known as <a
			href="https://github.com/18sg/SHET/blob/master/doc/spec.md#readme">the
			SHET protocol</a>.</p>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, as you might have guessed, the name is actually a
			backronym. From the <a href="irc/shetDesign.txt">IRC logs</a> of SHET's
			conception:</p>
			
			<pre>
(23:55:38) Jonathan: name for the protocol ?
(23:55:47) tomn: lol, no idea.
(23:56:00) Jonathan: karls: ideas?
(23:56:22) tomn: just string some buzwords together and acronym the hell out of
it :p
(23:57:10) Jonathan: :D
(23:57:30) Jonathan: take a list of rude or amusing words and swap the vowels
and then acronym the hell out of that </pre>
			
			<p>With the protocol designed, implementation was next on the list.
			Coursework deadlines loomed and so there was no time like the present and
			Tom set about writing the <a href="https://github.com/18sg/SHET">SHET
			Python API and SHET server</a> using the <a
			href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted framework</a>. Twisted
			describes itself as "an event-driven networking engine written in Python"
			and provides a really nice API for implementing network protocols.</p>
			
			<!-- TODO: Example client here -->
			
			<p>As well as a Python API, a command-line utility was also made
			(complete with bash-completion). It allowed easy direct interaction with
			SHET and its servers. For example, you could browse through the tree with
			tab completion:
			
<pre>
$ shet /jonathan/<span class="output">&lt;tab&gt;
/jonathan/arduino/  /jonathan/irc/      /jonathan/sound/
/jonathan/desktop/  /jonathan/mpd/      /jonathan/tts/
/jonathan/email     /jonathan/sms</span></pre>
			
			Call actions (with arguments) and see their returned values:
			
<pre>
$ shet /matt/mpd/toggle
<span class="output">0</span>
$ shet /tom/sms "Let me know when you get in"
<span class="output">null</span></pre>
			
			Get and set properties:
			
<pre>
$ shet /jonathan/sound/speakers/volume
<span class="output">100</span>
$ shet /jonathan/sound/speakers/volume 21
<span class="output">null</span>
$ shet /jonathan/sound/speakers/volume
<span class="output">21</span></pre>
			
			Watch events being raised:
			
<pre>
$ shet /lounge/panel/pressed
<span class="output">[6]
[4]
[1]</span></pre>
			</p>
			
			<p>Of course, this interface meant that we could actually write shell
			scripts to control our house. For example, alarm clocks which could turn
			on lights and music could be created in seconds using a <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> job.</p>
			
			<p>After a while we got fed up of the command-line client being relatively
			slow (due to the overhead of starting Python). This (and further
			coursework deadlines) was all the motivation it took for Tom to write a <a
			href="https://github.com/18sg/SHETC">C library for SHET</a> and a <a
			href="https://github.com/18sg/SHETCClient">command-line SHET client
			written in C</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The madness didn't stop here either as a <a
			href="https://github.com/18sg/shet-client.js">JavaScript library</a> appeared
			allowing us to build web interfaces trivially for any device. The library
			is built on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a
			href="http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a> and is just as feature complete as
			the C and Python versions.</p>

		<h2>SHETSource (Controlling Real-World Things)</h2>
			<img class="figure left"
			     src="images/arduino.jpg"
			     alt="An Arduino board.">
			<p>Right from the start, our aim was to control real things in our house
			like the lights. This meant having these things somehow connected to SHET.
			The answer we came up with was to use <a
			href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduinos</a> thanks to their ease of use and
			off-the-shelf availability. They would allow us to run simple programs
			which controlled motors, switches, sensors, lights and anything else we
			could wire up around the house.</p>
			
			<p>Of course, connecting these Arduinos to SHET posed a problem. Our first
			thought was that we might use an <a
			href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield">Ethernet shield</a>
			and connect them all to our computer network. Unfortunately, the shields
			would be too expensive and since there would only be one network socket in
			each room, we'd have to buy lots of Ethernet switches too. We'd also need
			to power the Arduinos and their attached peripherals. <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet">Power-over-Ethernet</a>
			was deemed too complicated and once again, too expensive.</p>
			
			<p>After dismissing various bad ideas involving long USB cables and
			repeaters, Tom remembered that 10/100 Ethernet <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pair#Cabling">only
			uses four of the eight wires</a> in a standard CAT-5 cable. As we didn't
			plan on using gigabit networking in our house, it meant we'd have four
			wires running from somewhere central in the house to every other room.</p>
			
			<!-- TODO: Picture of an adapter/socket -->
			<p>In order to use these unused wires, we had to make adapters which
			split off the four Ethernet wires and the four spare wires at each end.
			This meant re-writing the wall-sockets in each room and making adapters
			for the cables in our <del>comms</del> electrical meter cupboard where
			they were connected to the switch.</p>
			
			<p>You might be wondering how common it is to find a full CAT-5
			installation in a cheap student house and the answer is: not at all. When
			our very keen landlord offered to do "anything we could think of" while
			renovating the property we were pretty sceptical. A joking remark about
			fitting CAT-5 (and a plasma TV) were met with "sure" and we left not
			really thinking anything would happen. When he later contacted us to find
			out where we'd like the wall sockets we were pretty surprised.</p>
			
			<img class="figure right"
			     src="images/arduinoI2C.jpg"
			     alt="Two Arduinos connected via I2C via a mess of wires.">
			<p>So, with four wires available to us, this meant two for power and two
			for data (to keep things simple). Jonathan started experimenting with <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">I2C</a>, a simple data bus
			protocol, to connect the Arduinos together. There would be a 'master'
			Arduino connected to our server which would act as the interface between
			all the other Arduinos and SHET.</p>
			
			<p>Despite our enthusiasm, we realised I2C really wasn't designed for long
			wires. After lots of head-scratching, continuity testing and fiddling with
			I2C settings Tom eventually found an I2C booster that might be the answer
			to our problems. A few days later and we wired up our shiny boosters
			and...it still didn't work.</p>
			
			<p>At this point, we scrapped our plan of using I2C and instead started
			building a simple software serial library with basic flow control
			capabilities. To keep things simple, we decided to abandon the idea of
			using a bus and instead would connect the two data wires of each Arduino
			around the house directly into the otherwise unused pins of the master
			Arduino. The master would then route data to and from our server over USB.</p>
			
			<p>Once again we connected everything up and...it worked! Now all we
			needed was a way of exposing all this to SHET.</p>
			
			<p>After seeing the fairly dreadful performance of our serial link, we
			ditched any ideas about using the regular SHET protocol. Instead we
			considered a simple protocol which basically forwarded control of the IO
			pins back to our server. This idea seemed like an extremely wasteful use
			of Arduinos and so Jonathan set about designing a simple protocol which
			complemented SHET.</p>
			
			<p>The idea was that each Arduino should be able to create events,
			properties and actions within SHET. These could be, for example, motion
			sensors, lights and buzzers. To keep things simple, it was decided that
			Arduinos would not be able to access other events, properties and actions
			within SHET, instead SHET clients would be written to fill the gap. This
			also forced us to keep our "application logic" off the Arduinos which
			would save lots of time constantly reprogramming them.</p>
			
			<p>From this idea, <a
			href="https://github.com/18sg/SHETSource">SHETSource</a> was born making
			it trivial to connect real-world things to SHET. Take a look at the
			following Arduino sketch which makes the internal LED controllable over
			SHET:</p>
			
<pre>
#include &lt;pins.h&gt;
#include &lt;comms.h&gt;
#include &lt;SHETSource.h&gt;

/* Connect to SHETSource via pins 2 and 3. */
DirectPins pins = DirectPins(2,3);
Comms comms = Comms(&amp;pins);

/* The SHETSource client. Set that by default, nodes are created in the
 * /arduino/ subdirectory in SHET. */
SHETSource::Client client = SHETSource::Client(&amp;comms, "arduino");

/* Get the state of the LED */
int get_led(void) {
	return digitalRead(13);
}

/* Set the state of the LED */
void get_led(int state) {
	digitalWrite(13, state);
}

void setup() {
	client.Init();
	
	/* Use the built-in LED */
	pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
	
	/* Register a property for the LED in /arduino/led. */
	client.AddProperty("led", set_led, get_led);
}


void loop() {
	/* Execute one iteration of the SHETSource mainloop. */
	client.DoSHET();
}</pre>
			
			<!-- TODO: Makefile? -->
			
			<p>For an embarrassingly long time, SHETSource sat in a state of being
			usable but somewhat unreliable due to a <a
			href="https://github.com/18sg/SHETSource/commit/9375a8d717c180dda516f49bf5119adf72462828">simple
			timing bug</a>. With this fixed, everything ran smoothly until one day our
			electrical simplifications came back to bite us. After sitting down in the
			living room one day, Jonathan noticed various Arduinos were no longer
			responding. After chalking this up to yet another timing issue in the
			system, the problem sat ignored until later that evening when the affected
			Arduinos were found nice and toasty in their sockets. The cable carrying
			data and power to the Arduino in the lounge appeared to have shorted
			fairly badly taking out several Arduinos in the house. A binary search of
			the offending length of wire revealed a very poorly piece of cable trapped
			under a leg of the sofa.</p>
			
			<p>After replacing the cable and AVRs, we still didn't feel motivated to
			put any proper electrical protection in place and instead carefully
			blu-tacked the cable out of the reach of the evil chair leg. (Thus solving
			the problem <a
			href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0584437/quotes?qt=qt0446399">once and
			for all!</a>)</p>
			
			<!-- TODO: USB/Bluetooth -->
		
		
		<h2>Let There Be Light [Control]!</h2>
			<p>One of the major things we wanted our system to do was to control
			lights around the house. Unfortunately, a sensible respect for
			high-voltages, our land-lord's property and our own wallets meant we
			weren't going to be able to do anything especially fancy. After being
			inspired by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ojhZaP5_JI">the most
			useless machine</a>, Jonathan grabbed a servo motor, some trusty blu-tack
			and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQDLM653ABk">hacked the lights
			in his halls bedroom</a>.</p>
			
			<p>With this idea and a number of cheap (and apparently sand-lubricated)
			servos off ebay we gained control of almost all the lights around the
			house. Once again our shoddy electronics (and ridiculously long power
			wires) started causing us problems. When the servos were moved, they would
			stutter and nearby Arduinos would brown out. The solution was simply to
			add a nice meaty capacitor across the regulator that powered it.</p>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, a couple of rooms (perhaps ironically, those of SHET's
			principle developers, Tom and Jonathan) were fitted with dimmer switches which weren't
			especially forthcoming to servo control. Many an idea involving 3D-printed
			gears and dismantled CD-ROM drives was conceived but still the lights
			remained rebelliously uncontrolled.</p>
			
			<p>While Tom was browsing around Clas Ohlson he discovered some cheap,
			remote controlled wall sockets which looked like an ideal candidate for
			hacking. By hacking the remote, we would be able to control mains-voltage
			devices without touching anything high-voltage.</p>
			
			<p>This store, incidentally, is the supplier of a bewildering selection of
			goods notably including what we've dubbed '<a
			href="http://www.clasohlson.co.uk/link/m3/Product,Product.aspx?artnr=49-199-5"
			>SHAT-5</a>', the generic dual-twisted-pair cable SHETSource lives in
			after it leaves the safety of the CAT-5 wall sockets.</p>
			
			<p>With a selection of individually controllable standalone lamps lighting
			Tom's room, the hack was declared a success. Such was their effectiveness
			that when a light fitting broke in our hallway, Christmas lights and a
			wireless socket were rigged up (in June) and set up in SHET as the hallway
			lights and normal (if a prematurely festive) service was resumed.</p>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, Jonathan was still without controllable lighting.
			Tempted by Tom's discovery of relatively inexpensive LED strips, Jonathan
			ordered 5m of RGB LED strip with the hope of using it to light his room.
			Tom more sensibly opted for 5m of warm-white LEDs and we both waited as
			they made their way from China to our revision-worn hands.</p>
			
			<p>Somewhat unsurprisingly, the RGB LED strip produced a cold, blue-white
			light which wasn't going to be ideal for standard room lighting. It did,
			however, prove <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJAEzn9pHME">pretty
			awesome</a> when combined with <a
			href="https://github.com/matty3269/mattuliser">Mattuliser</a>, a music
			visualisation library Matt wrote.</p>
			
			<p>What was surprising was just how bright and how pleasant the warm-white
			LEDs Tom bought were. Lengths were hung around his room and connected to
			his Arduino via some questionable ebay MOSFETs (with equally questionable
			heat sinks). The result was dimmable and very pleasant lighting and a
			further order of the same LED strip from Jonathan. A little while later
			and Jonathan's room too was bathed in glorious PWM'd light.</p>
		
		<h2>Who needs light switches anyway? (Automatic Lighting)</h2>
			<p>What use are computer controlled lighting without some sort of motion
			detection to automate turning lights on and off? The idea of hacking the
			burglar alarm's <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_infrared_sensor">PIR</a>?s
			(motion detectors) came
			up early on. Unfortunately we didn't want to annoy our landlord (or
			neighbours) by tampering with it directly and so settled with attaching an
			LDR (light sensor) over the flashing LED (so that's why they flash...).</p>
			
			<p>Not every room had a PIR and so we turned
			again to ebay and bought some cheap PIR modules. When fed 5v, these
			modules simply provide a pulse easily read by an Arduino whenever they
			detect movement. Easy!</p>
			
			<p>With controllable lights and motion sensors all over the house all we
			needed to do was quickly hack together a SHET client to "just do the
			obvious thing". Unfortunately, as with any human interface problem, it
			turned out this was going to be harder than we thought...</p>
			
			<!-- TODO: Story of the lighting server -->
		
		
		<h2>The Button Panel (of Dreams and Nightmares)</h2>
			<p>Despite the fact that our system allowed us to automate many things,
			others would always require direct human interaction. One place in
			particular, our lounge &amp; kitchen, required particular attention as
			there were plenty of opportunities for SHET control.</p>
			
			<p>We search around the piles of miscellaneous buttons, dials and LEDs we
			had lying around and came up with an idea for a control panel. As there
			are five of us in the house, we wanted to have at least one button per
			person. For example, you could press a button and your playlist would be
			copied onto the computer in the lounge. In order to make the most of this
			small number of buttons, we wanted to allow chording (pressing more than
			one key at once) and long-pressing to squeeze more functions into the
			panel.</p>
			
			<p>Despite the existence of theoretically up to 30 different actions, the
			system would be very arbitrary and unpleasant to use or learn. To make
			things clearer, we decided we'd add another button to allow multiple modes
			to be selected. For example, in a 'music' mode, you can easily control
			playback by pressing one of the five buttons or grab your playlist by
			pressing and holding 'your' button (as dictated by the alphabetical
			ordering of our names). In a 'washing machine reminder' mode, you could
			press your button to book a reminder and press-and-hold to clear it. To
			indicate what mode the panel was in, we added an RGB LED and each mode was
			allocated a colour.</p>
			
			<p>Pressing the mode button would cycle through the different modes
			(giving a pleasing demo of the RGB LED...) and pressing the mode button
			along with one of the five main buttons a specific mode could be selected.
			This meant that we'd have only 5 modes and that wouldn't allow us to also
			have our own personalised modes. As a result, we added a second mode
			button which gave us each our own personal modes.</p>
			
			<p>With all this talk of modes Matt, our resident <a
			href="#TODO emacs_finger">Emacs</a> user, was getting uncomfortable. We're
			also computer scientists and so the thought of being limited to only 300
			actions seemed limiting. To improve the situation, a modifier key was
			added named the 'middle-switch'.</p>
			
			<p>Surprisingly, this system proved reasonably easy to use, especially
			given that in essence it was a box with 8 anonymous buttons and an LED.
			Now that we had our system, we needed a way to bind key presses to things
			in SHET. Faced with this task, Jonathan set about creating <a
			href="https://github.com/18sg/Panel-O-Matic-SHET-Client">panel-o-matic</a>.
			It consists of a custom language for specifying button behaviours and a
			SHET client which takes button-press and mode-change events from the panel
			and sets properties or calls actions as appropriate. Here's an example of
			a configuration file.</p>
			
<pre>
MUSIC {
	// In music mode, pressing a button will trigger one of the following actions
	0 =&gt; /lounge/mpd/prev;
	1 =&gt; /lounge/mpd/next;
	2 =&gt; /lounge/mpd/toggle;
	3 =&gt; /lounge/amplifier/vol_dec 20;
	4 =&gt; /lounge/amplifier/vol_inc 20;
	
	// Pressing the 'middle-switch' (modifier) and button 0 enables random mode
	^0 :&gt; /lounge/mpd/random 1;
	// Pressing and holding with the middle-switch turns random mode off.
	_^0 :&gt; /lounge/mpd/random 0;
	
	// The _ indicates "holding down" a key, and the special "any(...)" syntax
	// allows any one of the listed keys to be pressed and the associated string
	// be passed to the action as an argument.
	_any(0 : "james"
	    ,1 : "jonathan"
	    ,2 : "karl"
	    ,3 : "matt"
	    ,4 : "tom") =&gt; /lounge/mpd/copy_playlist_from;
} </pre>
			
			<p>With the panel finished, it was time to put it to work. The first and
			most obvious thing to do was allow control of MPD (the media player on our
			lounge computer). Since we already had an MPD SHET client, this simply
			required adding all the actions we wanted to the button panel
			configuration and took all of 5 minutes!</p>
			
			<p>With a sensor on the washing machine and the SHET email-sending client,
			we had been setting up reminders by using the 'bind' client to set up a
			one-off binding that would cause the 'washing finished' notification to
			call the 'send email' action for the appropriate person. To allow bookings
			to be made and cancelled from the button panel, all we needed for
			each person was a panel-o-matic configuration along the lines of:
<pre>
// Booking reminders with a press
0 =&gt; /bind/once /lounge/washing_machine/finished /james/email;
// Cancelling reminders with a press-and-hold
_0 =&gt; /bind/rm /lounge/washing_machine/finished /james/email;
</pre>
			Once again, a really useful feature implemented with a minimum of effort.
			As a finishing touch, we bound the "washing starting" event to change the
			panel to the reminder booking mode automatically.</p>
			
			<div class="figure right"
			     style="width : 250px; height : 200px; background-color : #AAA;">
			</div>
			<p>Another feature we wanted was to be able to browse our <a
			href="http://recipes.18sg.net">house recipe website</a> from the panel.
			Again, all we needed was to use the panel to trigger calls to the
			'keybind' client on the lounge computer. As you can see from the video,
			the panel makes a surprisingly usable interface for browsing around from
			the other side of the kitchen.</p>
			
			<p>We've also got a mode for interacting with IRC enabling requests for
			washing up and letting people know when dinner is ready.</p>
			
			<p>We have one other miscellaneous mode which contains useful commands for
			interacting with the computer (such as close window). It also has a button
			which 'powers down' the room turning off music, screens and lights and
			turning on a light in the hallway.</p>
			
			<p>The individual user modes have been fairly sparsely used in practice.
			They do however serve a few useful services. For example in Jonathan's
			mode there is a button which turns off his lights and music while copying
			his playlist into the lounge media player and launching the recipe
			browser. It also serves some less useful (but obviously more important
			services), for example, Matt's mode is an in-joke and meme sound-board.</p>

		<h2>Getting Started (Downloads &amp; Docs)</h2>
			<p>We think SHET is a really cool base for hackable home automation
			systems. If you're interested in trying it out yourself then here's a few
			links you might want to get started. SHET and SHETSource are currently
			moderately well documented and fairly stable so you should be able to get
			going without too much difficulty.</p>
			
			<p>As you might imagine, a lot of the clients we've written are very
			specific to our house's setup and quickly hacked together to scratch an
			itch. They also come with an embarrassing quantity of documentation but
			hopefully should be occasionally useful.</p>
