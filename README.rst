SHET Happened
=============

A nice and verbose tale of SHET and our home automation happenings.


General Idea
------------
My idea would be to have this just be one ma-hoosive page (with a TOC after the
introduction, probably), liberally sprinkled with images, amusing quotes,
diagrams and videos. Main reason for this is after quarter-of-an-hour fiddling I
couldn't find a good way of making a nice-looking menu for this design... 

As for what will actually be on the page, well, we need to decided, organise and
write all that... Oh and we'll need to draw all the diagrams and take/find any
pictures we need. Fun times! Hopefully we can HaD this too :).

My preference would be to keep the writing style informal and story-like and if
possible humorous.


Topics
------

What follows is a very quick list of stuff that came to the top of my head
thinking about this...

* Who we are, why we met, we started before finding house, IRC, yada yada...
* Motivation: wild ideas had, X10 shit, all expensive, all mod building...
* SHET: shell script everything! ok at least dirs, ..., SHET principles, API
* SHETSource: motivation (ards are crap), I2C, not use hardware, CAT5 hack,
  reliability, speed, limitations, building for Ard
* Lights: Servos, RF Sockets, LEDs
* Motion: PIRs & Alarm hack
* Washing Machine
* Oven
* Back door
* Panel
* LIRC
* Amp
* MPD
* SMS, Email, IRC
* Bind
* Lighting Server, turns out to be non-trivial (the whole story!)
* Touch panel
* Doorstop
* Clicky microswitch UI (like halls but with Morse...)
* Door-handle hack
* Key bindings & personal hacks (eg docking lights)
* Wiring (generations there-of) -- synergy hub!
* IO Expander (motivation, epicness, oh look, I2C!)
* Future SHETSource: bus, mbed(?), full shet with ethernet?
* Future s/w: better bind, merge shetworks, more languages (lua?)
* Future hacks: ???
* Getting started links/outline
* Bluetooth
* Direct USB
* Blu-tack, Cable Ties, Gaffer-Tape and lollipop sticks
